# Background and Motivation

The coupled dipole method is a convenient approximation to describe multiple scattering in relatively sparse clusters of particles (or molecules) smaller than the wavelength.

The central approximation is that the response of a given particle to the incident field is described in the electric dipole approximation as
```math
\mathbf{P} = \mathbb{\alpha} \mathbf{E}
```
where ``\mathbf{E}`` is the net electric field at that location. More details on the theory are summarised [here](./theory).
