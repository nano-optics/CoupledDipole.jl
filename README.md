Coupled-dipole simulations for electromagnetic scattering of light by sub-wavelength particles (or molecules) in arbitrary 3-dimensional configurations. Scattering, extinction, and absorption spectra are simulated by inversion of the linear system of coupled-dipole equations. High-level functions are provided to simulate spectra with varying angles of incidence, as well as with full angular averaging.
